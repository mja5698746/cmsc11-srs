THE CMSC11 Student Registration System
A simple and basic database system that records students and the subjects that they are enrolled in. This group project (code) was made in compliance for our CMSC11 subject. 

FEATURES:
1.) The Student Records
	a. Creating the Record
		- the user can create a record manually or import the records from a .txt or a .csv file (limited functions if using import). A maximum of 70 students can be accomodated. The records must contain: a unique student ID, Last name, First Name, Section, Exam 1 Score, Exam 2 Score, Exam 3 Score and three enrolled subjects. Editing and deleting a selected record is possible. 

	b. Display of Student Records 
		- all of the students will be displayed alphabetically by their last names. Added to the display is the total of their exam scores, and their grade equivalent following a grading system. At the bottom of the display is a table of statistics of the overall student data base.
